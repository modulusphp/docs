# Contribution Guide

The development of the Modulus framework started around March 2018 and has been under development and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/donaldp" title="Donald Pakkies">1 Developer</a>. This framework is still new, and it isn't expected to work as perfect like other frameworks that have been around longer than Modulus has, as Modulus has not been tested well enough.

### Bug Reports

Before submitting a bug report, keep in mind that this is the first official release and a lot of features are not expected to work as expected.
When submitting a bug report, you should also submit a fix or provide a solution. All bug reports should be presented and explained well enough for the developers and followers of the project to understand.
